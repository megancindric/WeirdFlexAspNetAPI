# WeirdFlex AspNet Web API

## A full-stack application that will allow users to record their one rep max for a specific lift, which will then be translated into some other item of equivalent weight the user could lift.  For example:

> You can bench press 120 pounds, or about 6 watermelons, 6 Dachshunds, or 2/3rds of a kangaroo!
